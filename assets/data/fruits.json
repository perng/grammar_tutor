She met a worm named Willy who became her friend. Together, they crossed a river and climbed a hill. At the top of the hill, they found a tree full of golden apples. Annie was amazed by the sight. They shared an apple and enjoyed the sunset. As night fell, they saw the stars twinkling in the sky. Annie realized that home was where her heart was. She thanked Willy for the journey and decided to return to the orchard. Back home, the other apples listened to her stories with awe. Annie was happy to be back but treasured the memories of her adventure.",
