In Chinese, we often just add a particle or change intonation, but English changes the word order.\n\nStudent: [Where are you going?|You are going where?] \nTeacher: Good. We move the auxiliary verb 'are' to the front.\n\nStudent: [Do you like this?|You like this?] \nTeacher: Yes. For regular verbs, we add 'Do' at the start.\n\nLet's practice more:\n\n1. [What is your name?|Your name is what?]\n2. [Are you ready?|You are ready?]\n3. [Does she speak English?|She speaks English?]\n4. [Where does he live?|He lives where?]\n5. [Can you help me?|You can help me?]",
