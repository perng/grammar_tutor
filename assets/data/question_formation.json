In Chinese, we often just add a particle or change intonation, but English changes the word order.\n\nStudent: [Where are you going?|You are going where?] \nTeacher: Good. We move the auxiliary verb 'are' to the front.\n\nStudent: [Do you like this?|You like this?] \nTeacher: Yes. For regular verbs, we add 'Do' at the start.\n\nLet's practice more:\n\n1. [What is your name?|Your name is what?]\n2. [Are you ready?|You are ready?]\n3. [Does she speak English?|She speaks English?]\n4. [Where does he live?|He lives where?]\n5. [Can you help me?|You can help me?]",
    "explanationZhTw": "英文疑問句需要調整語序。\n1. Be動詞 (am, is, are) 或助動詞 (can, will) 要移到主詞前面。\n   例如: You are ready. -> Are you ready?\n2. 一般動詞疑問句需在句首加助動詞 Do/Does。\n   例如: You like this. -> Do you like this?\n3. 疑問詞 (Where, What, How) 永遠放在句首。\n   例如: Where are you going?",
    "explanationEnUs": "English questions require changing the word order.\n1. Move the Be verb (am, is, are) or auxiliary verb (can, will) before the subject.\n   e.g., You are ready. -> Are you ready?\n2. For other verbs, use the auxiliary 'Do' or 'Does' at the beginning.\n   e.g., You like this. -> Do you like this?\n3. Question words (Where, What, How) always go at the very front.\n   e.g., Where are you going?",
